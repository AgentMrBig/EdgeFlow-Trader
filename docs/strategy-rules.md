## ðŸŽ¯ Strategy Overview

This strategy is based on **aggressive scalping** using price action, the **10-period moving average**, and key **support/resistance levels**.

It aims to enter short trades during micro-trend breakdowns, especially when price uses the 10MA as dynamic resistance before breaking a previous swing low.

## ðŸ“ˆ Entry Criteria (Sell Setup)

| Condition | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **1. MA Break** | Price **closes below** the 10-period moving average (red line). |
| **2. Retest** | Price **retraces back to the 10MA**, slightly touches or pierces it. |
| **3. Break of Low** | Price then **moves down and breaks a previous swing low**. |
| **4. Confirmation Window** | Time must be between **7:30 AM â€“ 11:00 AM EST**. |
| **5. No Overlap** | Max 4 trades open â€” no entry if already at limit. |
